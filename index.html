				<h2>Early Life</h2>
				<p>Hoori was born to an Iranian-Jewish family in December 1937 in Hamadan, Iran. She was the last of 9 children.  After Israel’s independence, she enjoyed visiting there with her family and making friends. In school, she learned French, how to sew clothes, and would sing on the radio after school. </p>
				<h2>Adulthood</h2>
				<p>When Hoori was 21, she got married to Mansoor Sedaghat who had a store where he would sell imported goods from Europe and America.  At 22, she gave birth to her first of 4 children- Eliza, Alfred, Fariba, and Sharona. Every summer, they would take their children to Israel. /p>
				<h2>Historical Background</h2>
				<p>Beggining 1977, civil unrest in Iran was becoming more common and many people started protesting the Shah- the king of Iran. Many critisized his modernization and Westernization programs and accused him of being a puppet of Western nations. People against the Shah became more outspoken and protests increased. In 1928, almost 500 people were killed in a fire set in a movie theater. The protesters and the Government blamed each other for the incident and tensions escalated. Even more protests against the government erupted and they demanded the Shah be removed and for revolutionist Ayatollah Khomeini who was exiled for speaking out against the Shah to be returned to Iran. Workers at oil refineries and government offices went on stike and even more people joined protests. Protesters were met with deadly forces from the government which escalated the situation. In 1979, the Shah leaves with his family and Khomeini returns and takes over the government. Iran became an Islamic Republic and women are required to cover their hair when they leave their houses. Those who opposed the new government or who broke the rules were jailed or killed by the Revolutionary Guard.</p>
				<h2>Her Story</h2>
				<p>Hoori and her family were aware of the political climate upcoming the Revolution. In her oldest daughter’s classroom, they began ripping out images of the Shah in schoolbooks and they made the decision to send her to Israel when the protests were beggining. Many people were being targeted and killed, especially the Jewish people who had Israel stamped in their passport. Many people began fleeing the country as the protests were starting. They sent their son to the United States through a program that took in young Jewish boys who fled from Iran. The rest of their family decided to leave to Israel but Mansoor decided to return to settle his affairs left in Iran. They remained in Iran for 4 years before protests were getting more and more prevalent. In 1980 when the Iran-Iraq war began, and she recalled covering the windows and hearing the missles land near their house. While the war was going on, the Iranian government would hang those who they thought were conspiring against them, including people that they knew. Mansoor went to get a passport so that they could try to leave but he was questioned on why he was in Israel. Then the airports and borders were closed and they had no way of leaving.</p>
				<p>They decided to take a risk by trusting a man who would show them a way out of Iran through the Turkish border.  They took whatever they could carry and made a long journey to small Iranian towns near the border before one night they were crossed into to Turkey on horses through the mountains. They arrived in Bashkalan, Turkey where they were found by the police and brought to a community where other Iranians who escaped were staying temporarily.  They stayed there for 1 month before they were taken further into Turkey where they showed their passports and they were allowed to leave. They then traveled to Israel where they stayed for 6 years before leaving to the United States.</p>
